Mad Wheels is a casual driving simulation game developed as a 7-day speed-run project, where chaos meets control in a city full of reckless drivers. In this unpredictable urban environment, you're tasked with navigating the streets safely while everyone around you drives like a maniac. The goal? Survive and complete various unique game modes that test your precision, patience, and driving skills. Choose from four distinct vehicles — Hatchback, Pickup, SUV, and Sports Car — each with their own strengths and weaknesses in handling, speed, and fuel efficiency. The game offers multiple modes to keep the experience fresh and challenging:
1) Endless Mode – drive as long as you can without crashing.
2) Brake Fail – your brakes are gone; stay alive!
3) Speed Run – beat the timer by reaching the goal quickly.
4) Parking Mode – carefully maneuver into tight spots.
5) Low Fuel – reach the finish line before you run dry.

Built in Unreal Engine 5.5, Mad Wheels is a showcase of rapid development using both Blueprints and C++ for core gameplay logic. The game uses Unreal's Vehicle Plugin to implement realistic car movement and physics. For content, it features vehicles from the Vehicle Car Asset Pack (sourced via Fab) and low-poly city buildings from Sketchfab, creating a stylized and lightweight urban environment. All user interface elements — including menus, buttons, and icons — were created with the help of ChatGPT, ensuring quick iteration and consistency across the UI. Sound design was handled using MetaSounds for vehicle effects, and free background music   assets were integrated to enhance immersion. With its clean visuals, responsive controls, and variety of driving modes, Mad Wheels focuses on providing a polished and fun driving experience — all within a 7-day game jam challenge.
