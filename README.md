Mad Wheels is a casual driving simulation game developed as a 7-day speed-run project, where chaos meets control in a city full of reckless drivers. In this unpredictable urban environment, you're tasked with navigating the streets safely while everyone around you drives like a maniac. The goal? Survive and complete various unique game modes that test your precision, patience, and driving skills. Choose from four distinct vehicles — Hatchback, Pickup, SUV, and Sports Car — each with their own strengths and weaknesses in handling, speed, and fuel efficiency. The game offers multiple modes to keep the experience fresh and challenging:
1) Endless Mode – drive as long as you can without crashing.
2) Brake Fail – your brakes are gone; stay alive!
3) Speed Run – beat the timer by reaching the goal quickly.
4) Parking Mode – carefully maneuver into tight spots.
5) Low Fuel – reach the finish line before you run dry.
